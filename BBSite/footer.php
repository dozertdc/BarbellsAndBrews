            <span class="intro">Barbells and Brews is without a doubt the best "local" competition</span>
            <span class="more">I've ever been to as either a participant or spectator. Travis and his team blended a professionally run USAW competition with a fun and festive atmosphere at a phenomenal microbrewery. The Barbells and Brews team created an experience that any weightlifter and fan of the sport can appreciate. I've competed at both events in Charlotte, NC and it's has only gotten better. I Can't wait until next year as it truly is a can't miss competition for weightlifters at all experience levels.</span>

            <span class="intro">Barbells and Brews is a great event for lifters, spectators, and vendors.</span>
            <span class="more">Over the past two years, my company, Freak Athlete Apparel has been a vendor at Barbells and Brews. We have enjoyed being a part of the event and supporting local lifters. Barbells and Brews brings a unique perspective on what a weightlifting event is and can be. The atmosphere brings the best out of each and every lifter, and athletes at all levels always lift really well. We look forward to being a part of future events.</span>

            <span class="more">has introduced me to a new type of weightlifting event. The atmosphere is exciting and upbeat. The music is loud, the crowd is rowdy, and after the competition is over I can kick back and have a great beer! I will definitely be attending this event as long as it exist.</span>

            <span class="intro">I've always been a huge fan of weightlifting, and I've always been a huge fan of a good craft beer. Combining the two</span>
            <span class="more">is the perfect combination for an event. Travis Cooper and The Weightlifting Scoop have found a good mix between a sanctioned weightlifting event and helping local businesses thrive. I feel a competition at a brewery helps athletes have more fun during and after they compete. Who doesn't love drinking a good beer while watching a sporting event?
            Being able to take photos at an event and enjoy every minute of it says a lot about how the event is run. I will continue to support Barbells and Brews event as long as it continues to grow!</span>
